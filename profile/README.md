## Hi there üëã

Common Test Report Format is a JSON test report schema that provides standardized JSON test results reports.

## We need your help

We believe CTRF can save a lot of time for engineers, a common data serialisation report schema, well structured, open source, community-driven and works with any framework. 

For over 30 years software engineers have used a de facto data serialisation report, *you know the one!* But we feel it‚Äôs time to modernise.

The only way we can grow CTRF is with your help and the support of the software engineering community.
